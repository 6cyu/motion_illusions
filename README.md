# Motion Illusions

Support library for 2020 Telluride Neuromorphic Engineering Workshop Challenge "Insights into the Early Motion Pathway (VISION)"

## Dependencies

* Python >= 3.6
* CUDA enabled GPU
* See `requirements.txt` for python dependencies

## Setup

Since training neural networks is the goal it assumed a GPU is available.

Clone the repository, initiate submodules, download pre-trained UnFlow model weights.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/prgumd/motion_illusions.git
cd motion_illusions
git submodule update --init
cd motion_illusions/pytorch_unflow
bash download.bash
```

### Docker
A Dockerfile is provided to build an image with all packages installed.
Some of the code assumes it can display GUIs using an X server. A `docker run` command is provided for Ubuntu host systems that configures the container for X forwarding.

Make sure docker is installed with access to the GPU.
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)

Run the following to build the docker image.

```bash
cd motion_illusions
docker build --tag motion_illusions:1.0 .
docker run --gpus all --rm -it motion_illusions:1.0 -v $(pwd):/workspace bash
```

To launch the container with X forwarding, GPUs available, and the latest version of this package:
```bash
cd motion_illusions
docker run  -u $(id -u):$(id -g) -e DISPLAY -v="/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw" --ipc host --gpus all --rm -it -v $(pwd):/workdir motion_illusions:1.0 bash
```

The container will complain about having no user due to overriding the uid and gid for X forwarding. This is ok for our purposes, it is the simplest way to handle X forwarding without a security compromise. More details available [here](http://wiki.ros.org/docker/Tutorials/GUI).

### Virtualenv

Make sure the following is installed on the host.
* CUDA 10.1 or higher
* Python >= 3.6
* virtualenv ('pip3 install virtualenv')


Run the following steps to create a virtual environment, activate it, and install packages.

```bash
cd motion_illusions
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```
